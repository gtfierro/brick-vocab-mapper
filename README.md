# Brick-vocab-mapper

```
pip install brickmapper
```

This package is a simple wrapper around the OpenAI embeddings API to assist in
producing vocabulary mappings between external vocabs (like Haystack protos,
gbXML equipment names, or internal naming schems) and Brick classes.

You will need an OpenAI API key to compute your own embeddings. This costs money,
but is very cheap (much less than $1) to do for hundreds of terms.
We cache embeddings in `.index` files to avoid hitting the API again.
The `brick.index` file in this repo will allow you to run the example below without any OpenAI API calls.

You must provide your external vocabulary to the Brick mapper tool as a list of dictonaries.
Each dictionary defines key-value pairs of a single concept; this dictionary must contain a key called `name` which contains
the *unique* name of the term to be mapped.

There are two kinds of mappings that can be produced by the package:
- `stable`: a stable mapping performs a 1-1 matching of external terms to Brick classes; it does not permit overlaps
- `unstable`: an unstable mapping allows 1 external term to match multiple Brick classes and vice-versa

## Haystack Protos Example

```python
from brickmapper import Mapper
from rdflib import BRICK
import urllib.request
import csv

defns = []
# read haystack proto definitions off their website
request = urllib.request.Request("https://project-haystack.org/download/protos.csv", headers={'User-Agent': "Python script"})
response = urllib.request.urlopen(request)
rdr = csv.DictReader(response.read().decode('utf8').splitlines())
for row in rdr:
    # save each proto (e.g. 'air temp sensor point') as a dictionary
    defns.append({'name': row['proto']})

# create a new Mapper object which knows about the definitions. This will
# access OpenAI to compute embeddings if necessary
m = Mapper(defns, "haystack_proto.index")
# define which set of Brick classes we want to match against
# all points which aren't parameters (these have similar enough names it can confuse the mapping)
points = m.get_brick_classes(BRICK.Point, [BRICK.Parameter])
# all equipment in Brick
equips = m.get_brick_classes(BRICK.Equipment)
# concatenate these two lists of Brick classes
bcs = points + equips

# compute a 'stable' mapping (1:1 mapping)
stable = m.get_mapping(bcs, allow_collisions=False)
# compute an 'unstable' mapping that allows 1:n and n:1 matches
unstable = m.get_mapping(bcs, allow_collisions=True)

# loop through and print the stable/unstable matches
for k,v in unstable.items():
    print(f"{k}:\n\tunstable: {v}\n\tstable: {stable.get(k)}")
```

Gives output like:

### UI notes:
- is mapping correct/incorrect
